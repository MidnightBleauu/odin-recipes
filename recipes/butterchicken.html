        <h3> Cooking Instructions </h3>
        <ol> 
            <li>In a large bowl combine chicken with all the ingredients to create the marinade. (Leave covered for 30 minutes or overnight) </li>
            <li> Then get oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Begin adding chicken in batches of two or three, and fry 
                them in the pan until browned, but not fully cooked. For only 3 minutes at a time, 
                once they are browned set aside to finish cooking with the sauce. </li>
            <li> Heat butter or ghee in the same pan, and fry the onions till they start to sweat. 
                    Which will take about six minutes. (I enjoy caramelizing my onions). Be sure to scrape any browned bits as well.</li>
            <li>Add your garlic and ginger and saute for about one minute, then add your ground coriander, 
                cumin and garam masala. Let this cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant </li> 
            <li> Take your crushed tomatoes, chilli poweder and salt and combine in the pot or pan to simmer for 
                10-15 minutes, stirring until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown colour.</li>
            <li> Remove the pan or pot from heat, and carefully put into a blender and blend until its smooth. Then run
                the blended sauce through a strainer, and it should be velvety smooth. Add water to assist in the blending process if necessary</li>
            <li>Then pour the sauce back into the pan while straining it through a fine mesh sieve, and stir in the cream, sugar and fenugreek leaves. Add the cooked chicken from earlier 
                , and cook for 10-15 minutes. Until the chicken is cooked through, and the sauce is thick. </li>
            <li> Garish with cilantro, maybe some lime or lemon, and serve with some naan and basmatic rice. </li>
            <li> Eat and enjoy !</li>
            </ol>
